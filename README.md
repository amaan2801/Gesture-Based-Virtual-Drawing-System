# Gesture-Based Virtual Drawing System

## Overview

This project implements a real-time, touchless virtual drawing application using computer vision techniques. Users can draw on a digital canvas through hand gestures captured via a webcam, eliminating the need for physical input devices.

---

## Objectives

* Enable gesture-based interaction using vision-based systems
* Demonstrate real-time hand tracking and drawing
* Explore human–computer interaction using computer vision techniques

---

## System Workflow

The application follows the workflow outlined below:

1. Webcam Input Capture
2. Hand and Gesture Detection
3. Gesture Interpretation
4. Real-Time Drawing on Virtual Canvas

---

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **OpenCV**
* **NumPy**

---

## Key Contributions

* Developed a real-time hand gesture recognition pipeline
* Implemented an interactive virtual drawing interface
* Optimized system performance to ensure a smooth user experience

---

## Applications
